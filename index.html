        <h4> Career Goals: </h4>
        <p class="content1"> 
            Iâ€™ll never forget the moment I first realized how video games are run, which is through coding. From that day 
            forward, I knew I wanted to be a game programmer to create my own games exactly how I wanted. I believe I can achieve 
            this goal by learning how to program first. I can do this by taking computer science classes in high school, and major 
            in something like software engineering. This is my career choice because I've 
            always been interested in code for game development, and my parents have jobs in software engineering.
