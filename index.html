        <h4> Career Goals: </h4>
        <div class="text-image">
        <div class="paragraphs">
        <p class="content1"> 
            I’ll never forget the moment I first realized how video games work—through coding. From that day forward, I knew I wanted to become a game programmer so I could create my own games just the way I envision them. I believe I can achieve this goal by learning how to program. I plan to take computer science classes in high school and later major in a field like software engineering. This career path excites me because I’ve always been fascinated by coding for game development, and both of my parents work in software engineering.
        </p>
        <h4>Strengths and Personal Qualities:</h4>
        <p class="content2">
            Some qualities I have that are relevant to software engineering are patience and perseverance. When I encounter a bug or issue, I can stay calm and work through it without giving up or getting frustrated. I am also cooperative and experienced, as I can work successfully with others to solve problems in code.
        </p>
        <h4>Abilities and Work Skills</h4>
        <p class="content3">
            I’ve learned that I can work through most difficult problems I encounter. I’m currently in an advanced algebra class, one of the most challenging courses for freshmen at Emerald High. Despite facing many tough math problems, I persevered through concepts I struggled with, such as polynomials, and ultimately earned an A in the class.
        </p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p class="content4">
            As a freshman in high school, I may have less experience than others pursuing software engineering, but I can confidently say that I have the perseverance to work through bugs and coding challenges. For more information, feel free to explore my website. Thank you!
